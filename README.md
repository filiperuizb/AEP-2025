## Projeto

Bom dia pessoal, este aqui será o campo ue usaremos para ambientar o nosso desenvolvimento do projeto
- Irei ensinar vocês certinho só temos que marcar um dia todo mundo no discord pra eu ensinar como vocês vão subir as issues que vocês futuramente irão fazer, a princípio a ideia é que não iremos usar o git diretamente!

- Vou deixar tudo ambientando e pronto pro nosso desenvolvimento

## RESPONSABILIDADES
- Developer
- Ux/Ui
- Tester 

* Jmbonfim -> Developer/Ux/Ui 
* Enzo Bettini -> Developer/Ux/Ui/Tester
* Boligon -> Developer/Ux/Ui/Tester

 

```
Primeiramente clonar o repositorio MAIN ou outro desejado na maquina local

git pull -> utilizar para deixar as branches up to date

git branch -> utilizar para ver quais branches você tem localmente e qual voce esta

git checkout 'nome da branch'-> seleciona a branch que voce quer localmente

Comando abaixo para dar o sync com as branches remotas

git fetch origin
git checkout 'nome da branch'

git add 'nome do arquivo'-> adicionar mudanças

git commit -m "descrição da alteração" -> realização do commit

git push origin 'nome da branch' -> envio para o repositorio remoto






cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/macacosdoti/aep3s.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
